## Sofa-Solver-Rust

This programm aims to calculate the maximum area of a Sofa, by cutting out the shape of the sofa by moving the corridor along a curve. This approach is inspired by <u>this JugendForscht Paper</u> from <u>Patrick Sonnentag</u>.


## The Moving Sofa Problem

_In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the **moving sofa problem** or **sofa problem** is a two-dimensional idealisation of real-life furniture-moving problems and asks for the rigid two-dimensional shape of largest [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area) *A* that can be maneuvered through an L-shaped planar region with legs of unit width.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem#cite_note-Neal_Wagner-1) The area *A* thus obtained is referred to as the *sofa constant*._
